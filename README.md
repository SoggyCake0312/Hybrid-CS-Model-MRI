# Hybrid-CS-Model-MRI

Reconstructing magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled k-space measurements can potentially decrease MR examination times. This repository contains thesource code for a hybrid k-space/image domain model proposed by our group. Our model is called W-net. If you use this code in your experiments, we ask you to kindly cite our paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12473 

We expect to soon be able to make the MR raw-data publicly available as part of the Calgary-Campinas dataset (https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/home) for benhcmarking purposes.
